-**Use a mod like REI as the crafting recipes will be getting more difficult for the complex foods and I may not update the images here.**

-**Apple Skin is a mod that provides a good way of understanding how much hunger and saturation is gained by each food.**

**Currently only built for 1.17+ Fabric. No interest in backporting the project to previous versions as of right now.**

**This mod requires the Fabric API to run.**

**This is also my first-ever mod so disregard the horrible code, I will be refactoring things as I learn better practices.**
